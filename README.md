# Cornerstone responsive starter theme for WordPress


Cornerstone is a WordPress starter theme based on the [Zurb Foundation Responsive Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/). Cornerstone aims to provide a lightweight starter theme that is responsive and SEO friendly that web designers can build great looking websites on.

This version of Cornerstone is based on [ZURB Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

Cornerstone is not meant to be used as is. This theme is designed to be used as a parent theme to create a Child Theme from.
